# Operating System CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This repository implements various CPU scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems. The `main.py` file includes the implementation of the following algorithms along with their Gantt chart visualization. Also, it calculates the waiting time (WT), turnaround time (TAT), and average waiting (AWT) and turnaround time (ATAT) for each algorithm.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `scheduler_visualizer.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `scheduler_visualizer.py`.
3. Run the command `python scheduler_visualizer.py` to execute the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the algorithm and provide the necessary inputs.
5. The program will display the Gantt chart representing the CPU scheduling timeline and provide relevant statistics for each algorithm.

## Acknowledgements
The implementation of these CPU scheduling algorithms is based on the concepts and principles learned from operating systems courses and textbooks.
